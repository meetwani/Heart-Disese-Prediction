❤️ Heart Disease PredictionProject Team ID: PTID-CDS-JUL-25-2884Team Members:Meet WaniDeepak Jadhav1. OverviewThis project uses machine learning to predict whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on clinical data like age, cholesterol levels, resting blood pressure, and more. The goal is to assist hospitals or doctors in making faster, data-driven decisions.---2. Project Highlights- Complete ML pipeline: from data loading to prediction.- Visual EDA with univariate and bivariate analysis.- Preprocessing includes outlier handling, encoding, and scaling.- Multiple classification models compared (DT, RF, LR, SVM, KNN).- Evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.---3. Dataset- **Source**: Provided as `values.csv` and `labels.csv`.- **Features**: Includes age, sex, chest pain type, cholesterol, heart rate, etc.- **Target**: `heart\_disease\_present` (binary classification: 0 = No, 1 = Yes)- Small, clean dataset with no missing or corrupted values after initial checks.---4. Technologies Used- **Python**- **Libraries**:  - `Pandas`, `NumPy` – data handling  - `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn` – visualizations  - `Scikit-learn` – ML models, preprocessing, evaluation  - `SciPy` – Box-Cox transformation---5. Results- **Best Model**: Logistic Regression- **Accuracy**: 88.89%- **Recall (Positive Class)**: 100%- **ROC-AUC**: 0.94- High recall helps minimize false negatives (i.e., missing actual heart disease cases).
